    <h2 style="text-align:center;color:royalblue;font-size:large;">EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION</h2>
    <p style="font-size:medium;color:black">
    
       
        
Malaviya's education began at the age of five in Mahajani Pathsala. Later, he joined Hardeva's Dharma Gyanopadesh Pathshala, completed his primary education and joined a school run by Vidha Vardini Sabha. He then joined Allahabad Zila School (Allahabad District School), where he started writing poems under the pen name Makarand which were published in journals and magazines.

Malaviya matriculated in 1879 from the Muir Central College, now known as the University of Allahabad. Harrison College's Principal provided a monthly scholarship to Malaviya, whose family had been facing financial hardships, and he was able to complete his B.A. at the University of Calcutta.

Malaviya desired to pursue an M.A. in Sanskrit, but family circumstances did not allow him to do so, and his father wanted him to instead pursue the family profession of Bhagavat recital. In July 1884, Madan Mohan Malaviya began his professional career as an assistant master at the Government High School in Allahabad

          Malaviya started his political career in 1886 with an address to the Indian National Congress session in Calcutta. Malaviya would go on to become one of the most powerful political leaders of his time, being elected Congress president on four occasions.

In December 1886, Malaviya attended the second Indian National Congress session in Calcutta under the chairmanship of Dadabhai Naoroji, where he spoke on the issue of representation in Councils. His address not only impressed Dadabhai but also Raja Rampal Singh, ruler of Kalakankar estate near Allahabad, who had founded a Hindi weekly, Hindustan, but was still looking for a suitable editor to turn it into a daily. In July 1887, Malaviya resigned from the school and joined as editor of the nationalist weekly. He remained for two and a half years, and left for Allahabad to study for his L.L.B.. In Allahabad, he was offered the co-editorship of The Indian Opinion, an English daily. After finishing his law degree, he started practicing law at Allahabad District Court in 1891, and moved to Allahabad High Court by December 1893.</p>

In April 1911, Annie Besant met Malaviya and they decided to work for a common Hindu University in Varanasi. Besant and fellow trustees of the Central Hindu College, which she had founded in 1898, also agreed to the Government of India's precondition that the college become a part of the new university. Thus Banaras Hindu University (BHU) was established in 1916, through a Parliamentary legislation, the 'Banaras Hindu University Act of 1915', and today it remains a prominent institution of learning in India.In 1939, he left the Vice-Chancellorship of BHU and was succeeded by S. Radhakrishnan, who later became the President of India.

Spread over 16.5 km2 (4,100 acres) with a student population of about 30,000, BHU is the largest residential university in Asia.

Malaviya' son Pandit Govind Malaviya served as the Vice-Chancellor of BHU from 1948 to 1951. His grandson Justice Giridhar Malaviya is currently the Chancellor of BHU since 2018.</p>

The slogan "Satyameva Jayate" (Truth alone triumphs) is also a legacy of Malaviya. Presiding over the Indian National Congress session of 1918 at Delhi, he declared that this phrase from the Mundaka Upanishad should be the slogan for the nation.

Malaviya started the tradition of Aarti at Har ki Pauri Haridwar to the sacred Ganga river which is performed even today. The Malaviya Dwipa, a small island across the ghat, is named after him and a bust of his was erected on it. The Indian Post issued stamps in his honour in 1961 and 2011 to celebrate his 100th and 150th birth anniversaries, respectively.
2011 was celebrated as his 150th birth centenary by the Government of India under the Chairmanship of India's prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh, who announced the establishment of a Centre for Malaviya Studies at the Banaras Hindu University in addition to scholarships and education related awards in his memory, and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi released a biography of Madan Mohan Malaviya.

On 24 December 2014, Madan Mohan Malaviya was honored with Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

The Mahamana Express train (plying between New Delhi and Varanasi) was flagged off by Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi on 22 January 2016. The train is named after Malaviya and is equipped with modern facilities such as bio-toilets in every coach and air-conditioned compartments.</p>
